# CRITICAL: ENCODING ISSUE IN TASKMANAGEMENT COMPONENT

## Problem
The TaskManagement component has UTF-8 encoding corruption affecting Spanish characters:
- `GestiÃ³n de Tareas` â†’ `Gestiï¿½n de Tareas`
- `construcciÃ³n` â†’ `construcciï¿½n`

## Affected Lines
All Spanish text with accents throughout the component, including:
- Component titles and descriptions
- Button labels
- Status messages
- Category names

## Fix Required
Replace all corrupted characters with proper UTF-8 Spanish characters:
- `ï¿½` â†’ proper accented characters (Ã¡, Ã©, Ã­, Ã³, Ãº, Ã±)

## Status
ðŸ”´ BLOCKING - Must be fixed before commit/push

## Impact
- Display issues in production
- Poor user experience for Spanish-speaking construction workers
- Unprofessional appearance
