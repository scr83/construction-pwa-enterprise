# HANDOFF DOCUMENT FOR NEXT SESSION
## Construction PWA - Current State & Next Steps

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025, 20:00 GMT  
**Last Developer:** Sebastian  
**Status:** 9 of 10 implementation steps complete, app deployed and functional

---

## CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### What's Working RIGHT NOW

**1. Live Deployment:**
- URL: `https://construction-pwa-enterprise-535od8vap.vercel.app`
- Admin user: `admin@constructorpro.com` / `admin123`
- Build status: ✅ Successful
- Database: ✅ Connected and seeded

**2. Functional Features:**

**User Management** (`/admin/users`)
- Admin can create users
- Generates 8-character temp passwords
- Form validates name, email, role
- Shows all users in table
- **Known issue:** Users created as inactive, must manually activate in Prisma Studio

**Progress Calculation API** (`GET /api/projects/[id]/progress`)
- Calculates 4 progress categories (planning, materials, physical, payment)
- Returns weighted overall progress
- Based on 14 Chilean workflow states

**Weekly Progress Tracking** (`/jefe-terreno/weekly-progress`)
- Site managers can mark units completed
- Groups units by building/floor
- Sets week number
- Updates `completedThisWeek` and `weekNumber` fields

**Database:**
- 40 Chilean construction partidas seeded in `partidas` table
- 14 workflow boolean fields in `construction_activities` table
- Full schema at `prisma/schema.prisma`

---

## DATABASE SCHEMA KEY MODELS

```prisma
// Core hierarchy
Project → Building → Floor → Unit → ConstructionActivity

// Master data
Partida (40 records seeded)
  - id, name, category, sequence, budgetWeight

// Workflow tracking
ConstructionActivity
  - 14 Chilean workflow booleans:
    * kitMaterialInicial through pagoCursado
  - fechaEjecucion (timestamp)
  - completedThisWeek, weekNumber
```

---

## COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

**Step 1:** ✅ Database schema with 14 workflow states  
**Step 2A:** ✅ 40 partidas seeded  
**Step 2B:** ✅ Verified in database  
**Step 3:** ✅ Progress calculation functions (`src/lib/calculations/progress.ts`)  
**Step 4:** ✅ Progress API endpoint  
**Step 5:** ✅ User creation API  
**Step 6:** ✅ Admin user management page  
**Step 7:** ✅ User creation form component  
**Step 8:** ⏭️ SKIPPED - Dashboard mock data removal (TypeScript complexity)  
**Step 9:** ✅ Weekly progress interface  
**Step 10:** ✅ Weekly progress API

## CRITICAL GAPS (What Doesn't Work Yet)

### High Priority

**1. No Project Creation UI**
- Cannot create projects through UI
- Must use Prisma Studio or API directly
- Blocks testing of all workflow features

**2. No Workflow State UI**
- 14 workflow checkboxes exist in DB but no UI to toggle them
- Cannot mark units as "faenaEjecutada" or track other states
- Progress calculation works but has no data to calculate from

**3. Dashboard Shows Mock Data**
- Step 8 was skipped due to TypeScript refactoring risk
- Dashboard at `/dashboard` still uses hardcoded projects
- Real project data exists but isn't displayed

**4. Users Created Inactive**
- Bug in user creation - `isActive` defaults to false somehow
- Must manually fix in Prisma Studio
- Quick fix: Update `src/app/api/users/create/route.ts` line 71 to explicitly set `isActive: true`

### Medium Priority

**5. No Partida Assignment to Units**
- 40 partidas exist but aren't linked to construction units
- Need UI to assign which partidas apply to which units
- Blocks progress tracking

**6. No Construction Activity Creation**
- Units exist but have no construction activities attached
- Need to auto-generate activities when unit is created

## HOW TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT

### Option 1: Create Project Management UI (Highest Impact)

**Goal:** Let admins create projects with buildings/floors/units through UI

**Steps:**
1. Create `/admin/projects/new` page
2. Multi-step form:
   - Step 1: Project details (name, type, dates, budget)
   - Step 2: Buildings (name, number of floors)
   - Step 3: Floors per building (name, number of units)
   - Step 4: Unit configuration (names, types)
3. API endpoint: `POST /api/projects/create`
4. Auto-assign all 40 partidas to each unit as ConstructionActivity records

**Impact:** Unlocks all other features - once projects exist, workflow tracking works

### Option 2: Fix User Inactive Bug (Quick Win)

**File:** `src/app/api/users/create/route.ts`

**Change line 71:**
```typescript
// Current
isActive: true,

// Verify it's actually there and not being overridden
```

**Or add to seed-admin.ts to batch activate:**
```typescript
await prisma.user.updateMany({
  where: { isActive: false },
  data: { isActive: true }
})
```

### Option 3: Build Workflow State Toggle UI

**Goal:** Let site managers toggle the 14 workflow checkboxes per unit

**Create:** `/jefe-terreno/units/[id]/workflow` page

**UI:** 14 checkboxes in 4 groups:
- Planning (4 states)
- Materials (5 states)  
- Physical Work (4 states)
- Payment (1 state)

**API:** `PATCH /api/construction-activities/[id]/workflow`

### Option 4: Connect Dashboard to Real Data (Complete Step 8)

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Careful refactoring needed:**
1. Replace `generateProjectData()` mock with `fetch('/api/projects')`
2. Update interfaces to match real Project model
3. Test thoroughly - this broke before due to TypeScript mismatches

---

## TESTING THE CURRENT APP

### Test User Management
1. Go to `https://construction-pwa-enterprise-535od8vap.vercel.app/admin/users`
2. Click "+ Crear Usuario"
3. Fill form, submit
4. Copy temp password shown
5. Check Prisma Studio - user exists but inactive
6. Manually set `isActive = true`
7. Login with new user

### Test Weekly Progress
1. Login as site manager (need to create one first)
2. Go to `/jefe-terreno/weekly-progress`
3. Select some units
4. Set week number
5. Submit
6. Check database - `completedThisWeek` should be true

### Test Progress API
```bash
curl https://construction-pwa-enterprise-535od8vap.vercel.app/api/projects/PROJECT_ID/progress
```
(Will fail until projects exist with construction activities)

---

## KNOWN ISSUES & TECHNICAL DEBT

**TypeScript Errors:** 854 errors in old code (non-blocking, build succeeds)

**Missing Features from Original Spec:**
- Photo upload
- Quality inspection forms
- Material tracking UI
- Team management
- Subcontractor assignment
- Payment processing

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Skipped Step 8 to avoid breaking existing dashboard
- Using mock data in weekly progress (no real units yet)
- No project creation means most features untestable

---

## GIT & DEPLOYMENT

**Repository:** (Add GitHub URL here)

**To deploy changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin main
```

Vercel auto-deploys in ~2 minutes

**Current branch:** `main`

**Last commit:** "chore: change admin menu icon to shield"

---

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP

**Local development:**
```bash
cd /Users/scr/CONSTRUCTION-APP-v1.0
npm run dev
```

**Database:**
- Production: PostgreSQL on Vercel/Railway (check .env)
- Schema sync: `npx prisma db push`
- View data: `npx prisma studio`

**Seed scripts:**
```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed-partidas.ts    # Seed 40 partidas
npx tsx prisma/seed-admin.ts       # Create admin user
```

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT SESSION PLAN

**Session Goal:** Create project management so features become testable

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours

**Steps:**
1. Create project creation UI (1.5 hours)
2. Auto-assign partidas to units (30 mins)
3. Test end-to-end workflow (30 mins)
4. Fix user inactive bug (15 mins)

**By end of session, you'll have:**
- Working project creation
- Real units with real partidas assigned
- Progress API returning real data
- Weekly progress tracking actual units

---

## QUESTIONS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

Before starting, verify:
1. Can you access Vercel deployment?
2. Can you access Prisma Studio to view database?
3. Do you have admin credentials to test?
4. Is local environment working (`npm run dev`)?

If any issues, check:
- `.env` file exists with `DATABASE_URL`
- `npm install` completed successfully
- Port 3000 is available

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Current:** MVP with foundational workflow tracking (9/10 steps)

**Next milestone:** Functional project creation and workflow tracking

**Definition of done:**
- Can create project through UI
- Units have partidas assigned
- Can toggle workflow states
- Progress API returns real calculations
- Weekly progress tracks real units
