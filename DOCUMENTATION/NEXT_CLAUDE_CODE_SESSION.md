## üéØ **IMMEDIATE TASK: Complete Final 4 Organisms**

**Copy this prompt exactly into the new Claude Code session:**

```
"I'm working on an enterprise construction management PWA with a complete atomic design system foundation. The project has 100% of the atomic + molecule foundation implemented (10 atoms + 9 molecules) and 5 enhanced organisms already complete.

I need you to complete the final 4 organisms to finish the component library:

PROJECT STATUS VERIFIED:
‚úÖ Complete Foundation: 10 atoms + 9 molecules all implemented with TypeScript, Storybook, mobile-first design
‚úÖ 5 Enhanced Organisms: NavigationBar, DashboardGrid, ProjectCard, TaskRegistrationForm, QualityChecklist (all complete and enhanced)
‚è≥ 4 Remaining Organisms: Need complete implementation from scratch

IMPLEMENT THESE 4 REMAINING ORGANISMS:

6. ReportViewer Organism (/src/components/organisms/ReportViewer/)
   - Construction reports and analytics display interface
   - Use MetricDisplay + StatusCard + Button + FilterDropdown molecules
   - Progress reports, budget variance analysis, quality metrics, safety reports
   - Export capabilities (PDF, Excel) and interactive data visualization
   - Role-based report access and filtering (Gerencia, Jefe de Terreno, etc.)
   - Mobile-responsive with touch-friendly chart interactions
   - Spanish construction terminology throughout

7. PhotoGallery Organism (/src/components/organisms/PhotoGallery/)
   - Construction photo management with metadata and annotations
   - Use PhotoUploader + StatusCard + Button + FilterDropdown + DatePicker molecules
   - GPS-tagged photo organization by project/unit/activity (partida)
   - Quality photo documentation with approval workflows
   - Photo filtering, searching, and batch operations
   - Annotation tools for quality inspections and progress tracking
   - Offline-capable photo sync with metadata preservation

8. TeamAssignment Organism (/src/components/organisms/TeamAssignment/)
   - Worker and subcontractor assignment and coordination
   - Use FormField + StatusCard + Avatar + Button + UserMenu molecules
   - Team performance tracking and workload distribution
   - Role-based team management interfaces for different construction roles
   - Assignment workflows with notifications and confirmations
   - Subcontractor management and performance ratings
   - Mobile-first for site manager use in field conditions

9. MaterialTracker Organism (/src/components/organisms/MaterialTracker/)
   - Material inventory tracking and workflow management
   - Use StatusCard + MetricDisplay + FormField + Badge + ProgressBar molecules
   - Complete material lifecycle: procurement ‚Üí receiving ‚Üí distribution ‚Üí installation
   - Integration with bodega (warehouse) management workflows
   - Material status tracking and low stock alerts
   - Spanish construction material terminology (cemento, fierro, hormig√≥n, etc.)
   - QR/barcode scanning preparation for material identification

REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL 4 ORGANISMS:
- Use the complete atomic + molecule foundation (19 components available)
- Follow atomic design principles exactly - combine molecules and atoms
- Include comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for construction workflows
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for construction field conditions
- Create detailed Storybook stories showing real construction scenarios
- Use professional Spanish construction terminology throughout
- Include proper error handling, loading states, and offline preparation
- Ensure accessibility and construction site usability (gloves, sunlight, etc.)
- Match the quality and depth of the existing 5 enhanced organisms
- Each organism should be 400-800+ lines of comprehensive functionality

CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY CONTEXT:
- Primary users: Spanish-speaking construction teams in field conditions  
- Project types: Residential, commercial, industrial, infrastructure
- Core workflows: Material management, work execution, quality control, payments
- Roles: Gerencia, Jefe de Terreno, Bodega, Oficina T√©cnica, Control de Calidad
- Mobile-first PWA for offline construction site use

Start with ReportViewer organism and work through all 4. After completion, we'll have the complete 28-component foundation ready for templates and pages!"
```
