# Project Creation Troubleshooting Session

## Issue Summary

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Fields still showing in red, validation still failing  
**Impact**: Project creation completely broken  

## Problem Statement

1. **UX Issue**: Required form fields display in red on page load (bad UX)
2. **Validation Issue**: Project creation fails with "Datos inválidos" error
3. **User Impact**: Cannot create new projects in the system

## Attempted Solutions (FAILED)

### 1. API Language Standardization ❌
**What was tried**: Changed API from English to Spanish field names
- Modified `/src/app/api/projects/route.ts` to accept `nombre`, `tipo`, `fechaInicio`, `fechaTermino`
- Added value mapping functions for project types
- Updated validation schema to Spanish

**Result**: FAILED - Validation still failing

### 2. Form Field Mapping ❌  
**What was tried**: Fixed field name mapping between form and API
- Form generates: `fecha_inicio`, `fecha_termino` (underscore)
- API expects: `fechaInicio`, `fechaTermino` (camelCase) 
- Added mapping in `/src/app/projects/page.tsx`

**Result**: FAILED - Fields still red, validation still failing

### 3. FormField UX Validation Fix ❌
**What was tried**: Prevent validation errors on initial render
- Modified `/src/components/templates/FormTemplate/FormTemplate.tsx`
- Added `formState.isDirty` check to required field validation
- Should only show errors after user interaction

**Result**: FAILED - Fields still red in screenshot

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Issue (NOT FIXED)

**Screenshot Evidence**: Fields are STILL showing in red with error icons, meaning:

1. **FormTemplate validation logic is still triggering on initial render**
2. **The `formState.isDirty` check is not working**  
3. **There may be multiple validation layers causing conflicts**

### Technical Debt Discovered

1. **Complex Form Architecture**: FormTemplate → FormField → Input validation layers
2. **Multiple Validation Sources**: 
   - FormTemplate internal validation
   - FormField component validation  
   - API-level Zod validation
3. **Language Inconsistency**: Mixed English/Spanish field names throughout stack

## Failed Commit History

1. **`ab6e2e7`** - "feat: standardize API to Spanish field names for project creation"
2. **`39b8157`** - "fix: resolve form UX and field mapping issues for project creation"

Both commits did NOT resolve the core issues.

## What Actually Needs to be Done

### 1. Deep FormField Component Analysis
The FormField component is still rendering in error state on initial load. Need to:
- Check if `validationState` prop is being passed as 'invalid'
- Verify `currentValidationState` logic in FormField.tsx:100-105
- Check if `errorMessage` is being passed from FormTemplate

### 2. Form Data Structure Analysis  
Based on console logs showing "Object", need to:
- Verify actual form data structure being generated
- Check if FormTemplate is collecting data correctly
- Ensure field names match between form config and form submission

### 3. API Validation Schema Testing
Need to test API endpoints independently:
- Create simple test payload matching expected Spanish schema
- Verify API accepts the correct field structure
- Test field name transformations

## Critical Files Involved

1. **`/src/components/templates/FormTemplate/FormTemplate.tsx`**
   - Lines 358-360: Required validation logic
   - Lines 554: Field error assignment
   - Lines 467: Field validation loop

2. **`/src/components/molecules/FormField/FormField.tsx`**
   - Lines 100-105: Validation state determination
   - Lines 147-153: Internal validation triggers
   - Lines 637: Error message rendering

3. **`/src/app/api/projects/route.ts`**
   - Lines 19-25: Spanish validation schema
   - Lines 214-219: Field mapping to database

4. **`/src/app/projects/page.tsx`**
   - Lines 53-59: Form data to API payload mapping

## Next Session Requirements

1. **STOP making assumptions** - Verify each step with actual testing
2. **Check browser console** for actual form data structures
3. **Test API endpoints independently** with curl/Postman  
4. **Debug FormField validation state** step by step
5. **Use console.log extensively** to trace data flow

## User Feedback

User expressed frustration: "you're not doing what you say you are doing"

**Translation**: The changes implemented are not producing the expected visual or functional results. Need to:
- Test changes immediately after implementation
- Verify screenshots/behavior match expected outcomes
- Stop assuming fixes work without validation

## Status: BLOCKED

Project creation remains completely broken. Both UX and validation issues persist despite multiple attempted fixes.
