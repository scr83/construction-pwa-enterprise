"Incredible work! The complete 28-component foundation is now finished. I can see all 10 atoms, 9 molecules, and 9 organisms are implemented with exceptional quality.

Now let's create the templates and pages to build the working construction management PWA:

PHASE 1: IMPLEMENT 5 TEMPLATES

1. DashboardTemplate (/src/components/templates/DashboardTemplate/)
   - Executive dashboard layout combining NavigationBar + DashboardGrid
   - Mobile-first responsive design with construction role-based sections
   - Support for all 5 construction roles (Gerencia, Jefe de Terreno, etc.)
   - Real-time metric displays and notification areas
   - Spanish construction terminology throughout

2. FormTemplate (/src/components/templates/FormTemplate/)
   - Construction form layouts using TaskRegistrationForm patterns
   - Multi-step form support with progress indication
   - Photo upload sections and validation displays
   - Mobile-optimized for field data entry
   - Role-based form field visibility and permissions

3. ListTemplate (/src/components/templates/ListTemplate/)
   - Project/unit listing layouts using ProjectCard + SearchBar + FilterDropdown
   - Infinite scroll and pagination support
   - Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Mobile-first responsive grid/list toggle
   - Construction-specific list organization (by phase, status, role)

4. ReportTemplate (/src/components/templates/ReportTemplate/)
   - Analytics layouts using ReportViewer + NavigationBar
   - Export functionality integration
   - Mobile-responsive chart and data displays

   - Touch-optimized navigation and interactions
   - Offline indicators and sync status
   - Construction site optimization (bright sunlight, gloves)
   - PWA-ready layout with app-like behavior

PHASE 2: IMPLEMENT 4 PAGES

6. Dashboard (/src/components/pages/Dashboard/)
   - Complete construction management dashboard using DashboardTemplate
   - Real construction KPIs and metrics integration
   - Role-based dashboard customization
   - Live data displays and notifications
   - Mobile-first executive and field manager views

7. ProjectManagement (/src/components/pages/ProjectManagement/)
   - Project overview and management using ListTemplate + FormTemplate
   - Project creation, editing, and status management
   - Unit management and construction activity tracking
   - Team assignment and material coordination
   - Complete construction project lifecycle interface

8. QualityControl (/src/components/pages/QualityControl/)
   - Quality inspection and approval workflows using FormTemplate
   - Digital inspection checklists and photo documentation
   - Approval/rejection workflows with corrective actions
   - Quality metrics and reporting integration
   - Mobile-optimized for field quality inspections

9. Reports (/src/components/pages/Reports/)
   - Construction analytics and reporting using ReportTemplate
   - Progress reports, budget analysis, quality metrics
   - Export capabilities and data visualization
   - Role-based report access and customization
   - Spanish construction reporting standards

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the complete 28-component foundation (all atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Follow atomic design principles: organisms ‚Üí templates ‚Üí pages
- Include comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for construction workflows
- Mobile-first responsive design optimized for construction field conditions
- Use professional Spanish construction terminology throughout
- Include proper error handling, loading states, and offline preparation
- Ensure accessibility and construction site usability
- Create production-ready pages for real construction company deployment

CONSTRUCTION CONTEXT:
- Target users: Spanish-speaking construction teams in field conditions
- Primary device: Mobile (smartphones/tablets) with PWA capabilities
- Core workflows: Material management, work execution, quality control, payments
- Roles: Gerencia, Jefe de Terreno, Bodega, Oficina T√©cnica, Control de Calidad
- Goal: Complete working construction management PWA

Start with DashboardTemplate and work through all templates, then implement all 4 pages. After completion, we'll have the complete working construction management PWA ready for deployment!"
