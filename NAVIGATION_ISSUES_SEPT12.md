# NAVIGATION SYSTEM ISSUES - SEPTEMBER 12, 2025

## CURRENT STATUS
Navigation bar exists and partially functions, but core management pages still inaccessible.

## VERIFIED WORKING FEATURES
- ✅ Navigation bar renders properly
- ✅ User dropdown menu functions (Mi Perfil, Notificaciones, Configuración)
- ✅ Role-based user display works (shows proper names and roles)
- ✅ Reports page works for all users
- ✅ Dashboard and Proyectos accessible

## CRITICAL FAILING FEATURES

### User: Juan Perez (JEFE DE TERRENO/SITE_MANAGER)
- ❌ Tareas link - Not working
- ❌ Materiales link - Not working  
- ❌ Equipo link - Not working
- ✅ Reports page - Working
- ✅ User dropdown - Working

### User: Administrador ConstructorPro (ADMINISTRADOR)
- ❌ Tareas link - Not working
- ❌ Materiales link - Not working
- ❌ Equipo link - Not working
- ❌ Calidad link - Not working
- ✅ All menu items visible in navigation
- ✅ User dropdown - Working

### User: Calidad (QUALITY_CONTROL)
- ✅ All navigation working properly
- ✅ Can access management pages

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
Navigation links are visible but the underlying pages/routes are still not functioning properly. This suggests:
1. Navigation component works correctly
2. Role-based visibility works
3. Individual management page components still have issues
4. Import/export problems in management page components persist

## REQUIRED FIXES
1. Verify management page component exports
2. Check individual page component functionality  
3. Test direct URL access to management pages
4. Ensure component imports are resolving correctly

## EVIDENCE
- Navigation appears in header correctly
- Links are clickable but don't navigate properly
- Only Reports page functions across all users
- Quality Control user has working navigation (baseline for comparison)

STATUS: Navigation UI fixed, underlying page components still broken
PRIORITY: HIGH - Core construction management features inaccessible
