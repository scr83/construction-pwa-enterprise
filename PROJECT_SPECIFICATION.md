# Enterprise Construction Management PWA
## Complete Development Specification

### Executive Summary
Design and implement a scalable, mobile-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) for comprehensive construction project management, following atomic design principles and enterprise-grade architecture patterns. The system must track the complete construction lifecycle from material planning through quality control and payment processing across any construction project type with repeatable units.

## 3. CORE BUSINESS LOGIC & METRICS TRACKING

### Universal Construction Workflow States
Based on comprehensive Excel analysis, implement these core business processes:

**1. Material Management Workflow (Bodega/Warehouse Department)**
```
Planning → Procurement → Receiving → Distribution → Installation
```
- `Kit Inicial Cotizado` (Initial Material Quote)
- `Solped Inicial Emitida` (Purchase Requisition Issued)
- `Kit Comprado` (Materials Purchased)
- `Kit Disponible en Bodega` (Available in Warehouse)
- `Kit Entregado a Terreno` (Delivered to Site)

**2. Field Operations Workflow (Site Management)**
```
Assignment → Execution → Quality Check → Completion → Payment
```
- `Faena Ejecutada` (Work Completed) with GPS/timestamp
- `Fecha de Ejecución` (Execution Date Tracking)
- `Entregado a Calidad` (Handed to Quality Control)
- `Trato Pagado` (Work Payment Confirmed)
- Photo documentation requirements per phase

**3. Technical Office Workflow (Engineering/Planning)**
```
Design → Material Planning → Contractor Assignment → Cost Control → Payment Processing
```
- `Kit de Material Inicial` → `Kit de Material Ajustado` (Material Planning & Adjustments)
- `Faena Contratada` (Work Contracted)
- `Subcontrato Asignado` (Subcontractor Assigned)
- `Pago Cursado` (Payment Processed)
- Budget vs. actual variance tracking

**4. Quality Control Process**
```
Inspection Request → Field Inspection → Documentation → Approval/Rejection → Handoff
```
- `Entregado a Calidad` (Submitted for Quality Review)
- `Recibido por Calidad` (Received by Quality Team)
- `Recepcionado por Asesoría` (Approved by Advisory)
- Digital checklists and approval workflows
- Non-conformance tracking and corrective actions
